            <h2>Summary of avengers movie</h2>
            "Marvel's The Avengers" (2012), directed by Joss Whedon, is a superhero film that brings together several of
            Marvel's iconic characters to form a team known as the Avengers. The film features Iron Man (Tony Stark),
            Captain America (Steve Rogers), Thor, Hulk (Bruce Banner), Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff), and Hawkeye
            (Clint Barton).

            The story begins with the villain Loki, Thor's adopted brother, stealing the Tesseract, a powerful energy
            source, from S.H.I.E.L.D., a secretive government agency. Loki plans to use the Tesseract to open a portal
            for an alien army, the Chitauri, to invade Earth and subjugate humanity. In response, S.H.I.E.L.D. director
            Nick Fury activates the Avengers Initiative, recruiting Earth's mightiest heroes to stop Loki and his army.

            Initially, the team struggles with internal conflicts and differing personalities. However, following an
            attack on the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier and the death of Agent Phil Coulson, the Avengers unite with a
            renewed sense of purpose. They track Loki to New York City, where he opens the portal above Stark Tower.

            In the climactic battle, the Avengers fight the Chitauri army in the streets of New York. Each member
            showcases their unique abilities, working together to protect the city and close the portal. Iron Man
            ultimately redirects a nuclear missile through the portal, destroying the Chitauri mothership and
            deactivating the invading forces. The film ends with Loki being captured and taken back to Asgard by Thor.

            "Marvel's The Avengers" was a critical and commercial success, praised for its action sequences, character
            interactions, and Whedon's direction. It marked a significant milestone in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,
            establishing the Avengers as a cornerstone of the franchise.

            <i><mark>About Earth</mark>
                Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is the only known world to harbor life. It has a unique
                combination of factors that support a diverse range of ecosystems, from the deepest oceans to the
                highest mountains. Earth's atmosphere, rich in nitrogen and oxygen, plays a crucial role in regulating
                the planet's climate and protecting life from harmful solar radiation.

                The planet's surface is dynamic, featuring continents that drift due to tectonic activity. This movement
                shapes the landscape, creating mountains, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. Earth's hydrosphere,
                covering about 71% of the surface, is vital for life. The oceans regulate climate by distributing heat
                and absorbing carbon dioxide.</i>

                <p>A computer is an electronic device designed to process, store, and retrieve data. Its core functions
                    include performing calculations, running applications, and managing various tasks. Computers consist
                    of hardware and software components working together seamlessly.

                    The hardware includes the central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM), storage devices (like hard
                    drives and SSDs), and input/output devices (such as keyboards, mice, and monitors). The CPU, often
